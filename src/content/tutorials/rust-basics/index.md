# Rust Programming Basics

Welcome to this comprehensive series on Rust programming! Rust is a systems programming language that combines the performance of low-level languages like C++ with modern safety features.

## What You'll Learn

In this series, we'll cover:

1. **Installation and Setup** - Get Rust installed and your development environment configured
2. **Understanding Ownership** - Master Rust's unique ownership system that ensures memory safety
3. **Error Handling** - Learn how Rust handles errors without exceptions

## Why Learn Rust?

Rust offers several compelling advantages:

- **Memory Safety** - Catch memory bugs at compile time
- **Performance** - Zero-cost abstractions and no garbage collector
- **Concurrency** - Fearless concurrent programming
- **Modern Tooling** - Excellent package manager (Cargo) and build system

## Prerequisites

- Basic programming knowledge in any language
- Comfort with the command line
- No prior systems programming experience needed!

## Course Structure

Each tutorial builds on the previous one, so we recommend following them in order. However, each part is self-contained enough that you can jump to specific topics if needed.

Let's get started with installing Rust!
