# Become a Rust Developer

This learning path takes you from complete beginner to a confident Rust developer capable of building real-world applications.

## Prerequisites

- Basic programming knowledge in any language (Python, JavaScript, Java, etc.)
- Command line familiarity
- Understanding of basic programming concepts (variables, functions, loops)

No prior systems programming experience needed! We'll introduce everything you need to know.

## What You'll Build

By the end of this path, you'll have built:

- Command-line tools
- Data processing applications
- Understanding of systems-level programming concepts

## Learning Approach

This path emphasizes:

1. **Hands-on Practice** - Every concept includes practical examples
2. **Incremental Learning** - Each tutorial builds on previous knowledge
3. **Real-world Applications** - Learn by building actual programs

## Time Commitment

Plan for approximately 10 hours of focused learning. Take breaks between tutorials to let concepts sink in, and don't hesitate to revisit earlier material.

## Getting Help

If you get stuck:
- Consult [The Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)
- Join the [Rust Users Forum](https://users.rust-lang.org/)
- Check out the [Rust Discord](https://discord.gg/rust-lang)

Let's start your Rust journey!
